## Design Patterns with NodeJS

> A design pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem.

In this repository I am going to implement some of the most important GoF design patterns. Javascript is a very flexible language and there are many ways in which we can implement Design Patterns, but what does not change is the overall logic behind them. 

When talking about design patterns we usually refer to the 'classical' ones which include Creational, Structural and Behavioral design patterns.

The following have been implemented in this repo:

| Creational    | Structural    | Behavioral  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:     |
| Factory       | Proxy         | Observer    |
| Singleton     | Adapter       | Strategy    |
| Builder       | Decorator     | Iterator    |
| Prototype     |               |             |
