## Adapter Design Pattern

> The Adapter pattern allows us to access the functionality of an object using
a different interface.

Adapters let the classes work together, acting as wrappers between them.

You can easily see the example working following these steps: 
1. `cd structural/adapter/`
2. `node index`
