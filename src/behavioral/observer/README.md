## Observer Design Pattern

> The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

There are two main actors in the Observer pattern: The Subject (Observable) and the Observer. The Subject takes care of notifying the Observer when state change happens.

You can easily see the example working following these steps: 
1. `cd behavioral/observer/`
2. `node index`
