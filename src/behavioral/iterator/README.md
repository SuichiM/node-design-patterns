## Iterator Design Pattern

> The Iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements.

The Iterator patterns allows us to access elements of an object sequentially without exposing the object structure. 

You can easily see the example working following these steps: 
1. `cd behavioral/iterator/`
2. `node index`
